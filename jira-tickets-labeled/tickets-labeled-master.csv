"Investigate - Add WBS # to ME2J report for PO's for Project Orders Please investigate if the WBS number associated with Maintenance Orders can be added to ME2J Report Layout. ME2J displays the object assigned to the Purchase Order. This can be confusing to Project Managers when they are reviewing costs for each project as Purchase Orders for Project Maintenance Orders will display the Maintenance Order but not the WBS. To find what projects these are for the PM must drill into each PO to find out the Project/WBS. This is very tedious and time consuming when reviewing POs for multiple projects (and there is no way to group the Project Maintenance Order PO’s with the other PO’s for same project).

"Account Management for PROP G/L Accounts requires update to allow Open Item Management - currently suppressed Mike Kennedy submitted request to change G/L account 153605 to a Open Item Management (OIM) account setup. This account falls under Account Group/Field Status Group PROP for 15xxxx accounts. This is in the OBD4 configuration. While standard practice is to suppress this option on Fixed Asset accounts, the reason for the suppression is for the PROP accounts that are recon A accounts. This specific account requested is a clearing account in the Property Accounts/Fixed Asset accounts section. A communication with Linda Neveu came to conclusion that there is minimal risk in setting this field to optional. G/L Master data changes are limited to only a few individuals and changes for the OIM field require additional steps if there is existing activity.

"Update Enlink Invoice to Reference Oneok? Today work was done to update Enlink data to be managed as Oneok data given the acquisition of Enlink by Oneok. I know work was done for this change in Maximo and I believe SAP as well. I noticed that there is an Invoice (172028586) within SAP which is still using the customer hierarchy number (CHN) of Enlink (2000081364) rather than the CHN of Oneok (2000012397). I am not sure if this is intended. My LSPI stores customers' invoice data within a SQL database so that the data can be quickly fetched without frequent API calls to SAP. Once an hour My LSPI looks at the invoice data stored in SAP and updates the SQL database entries to match the SAP values. Since the CHN for invoice 172028586 in SAP is still the Enlink CHN, My LSPI updates the SQL entry to be under the Enlink CHN even though we now want it to be under the Oneok CHN. I can manually update the SQL invoice’s CHN value to be under Oneok, but this will get reset at the next hour. Is changing the CHN for invoice 172028586 within SAP possible? Doing so would resolve this issue. (Thankfully this is the only Enlink invoice affected)",Data & Reporting,SAP

Any time a report contains expenses with money owed to LSPI (“Personal” expense type) or money owed to them (out-of-pocket expenses with “Cash” payment type or “Per Diem” expense type), the report will fail to post. I met with Concur Support today and they believe it may be an issue with the SAP Integration with Concur Solutions (ICS), they just are not sure which side (SAP or Concur); that would make sense to me considering this was not really an issue before we migrated to S4, from what I understand. Concur Support has suggested that I open a ticket with SAP via [ to understand what Concur should be sending to post successfully to SAP or if Concur is already sending the correct information and a change is necessary in SAP. However, I do not have a login for that site. Is this something you could assist with? Or could you please point me in the right direction? Concur provided me with the two attached JSON files to include in the support ticket. The component to include on the ticket is *BNS-CON-SE-S4-FIN* _Concur S4/Hana financial integration._ Thanks, * * * *Preston Cantrell** Internal Controls & Compliance LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. _ _2103 CityWest Blvd.,__ _Bldg 4_, _Suite 1400 Houston,_ _TX_ _77042_ +[ + | (713) 339-8794",Support & Inquiries,Access & Permissions

Is there an app to replace the ECC ABZE in fiori S4 we will need in GNVA & GCAN company codes. In the past we have used in house production transaction ABZE to create sub assets within the same year as the main asset was created. What transaction do we use in S4?,Support & Inquiries,
"GCAN - Modify Standard Accounts Table (T030) to record PPV on Interco GCAN transactions to newly created ICPPV account 433015 There are significant Purchase Price Variants being recorded on the Cost of Goods Sold on GCAN books for Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt. The items somewhat offset each other but still result in sizeable amounts on a monthly basis if GR and IR are not recorded in the same month. For Management reporting purposes on individual sales, these items along with GCANs total Cost of Goods Sold need to be left out of the results as the true Cost of Goods Sold for these intercompany sales are the original GNVA COGS. The GCAN COGS includes the intercompany markup/discount amount so is not the true COGS from a consolidated perspective. These amounts are currently recorded to 428015 PPV - Transferred. This account is currently included in the Financial Statement Version MGMT. A new account was created 433015 to reclass the GCAN PPV on these intercompany sales. A review of the activity of 428015 indicates that it is rarely getting bookings on GNVA and those bookings since Jan 1 2023 have been USD 0.01. The GCAN reclass entry could be quite complex as it would require Customer / Material information from the individual items being reclassed. The proposal is to change the automatic bookings to record directly to the 433015 so that GCAN would not be required to perform the manual reclass each month. Instead, a GNVA monthly close step could be added to review for any activity in 433015. History shows that an entry would be rarely if ever required on GNVA since it would not be necessary to make the USD 0.01 entries. The change would only be performed for Valuation Class 8032 as discussed in the attached e-mail.",Access & Permissions,Data & Reporting

"Inventory Report Issue? Hello! Kristen Parker noticed a potential issue with the Stock Multiple Materials report. Can you please advise based on the info she is provided below? I think we are having an issue with the Stock Multiple Materials report. I was trying to look for the railcars that are currently in route to warehouses, I would think the material should show on the Stock Multiple Materials report as In Transit, but it does not seem like they are...which means we are understating our total inventory on our reports. DRAX195846 (STO 4800006935) left Bryan and was PGI'd out on 4/10 and has not been GR'd into Stanton yet... But the railcar does not show up on the SMM report at all. It should be listed where the red line is chronologically. However - If I use the Display Stock in Transit report... It is there.

In a conversation with Linda today about a potential enhancement of our warehouse inventory process, us using batches vs SLOC’s came up and she suggested that its probably best to use SLOCs for storage tanks and batches just for ‘transportation equipment’ like ISOs and trailers and railcars since the storage tanks never move or change really, and she said making that change now makes it easier for the potential project we are going to have with just making that very specific and consistent across the board… SOOOOO I will re-draft an email to send back out to everyone saying “nevermind, going the other way” .

We would like to standardize the way we are managing our storage tanks across all warehouses to eliminate the potential confusion, especially as we get ready to add on more warehouses and more storage tanks. We had a follow up meeting with Jackie to get clarification on the reasoning behind Calgary being SLOCs and everything else batches. Turns out there is no real “right way” and we can do whichever way works best for us. We have made the decision to change all warehouses to batches since it would be easier to change one warehouse (Calgary) instead of all of the others. So that we are not making changes mid-month, we will make these changes at the end of this month before starting the June transactions. We will now use SLOC 0001 and Batch numbers with the below naming conventions. * Stanton – FRC## * Celta – FRC## * Leduc – FRC## * Calgary – CT## * San Angelo – CT## To make things easier – we will wait until May closing to make the changes so that we are not changing in the middle of the month. At the end of this month, we will need to move the inventory in the ‘FRC#’ (FRC1-FRC9) to the ‘FRC##’ (FRC01-FRC09) “batches”. and can you please assist with this? In talking with Jackie, it sounds like we can utilize cycle counts to easily transfer the inventory. It will need to be posted effective June 1st (the afternoon of June 4th, after inventory closes) before the inventory adjustments are made to ensure reconciliation is kept correct. is willing to help with the cycle counts if needed. Jackie will be blocking the batches and maintaining the history on them so they can be referenced as needed. Let us plan to block stock in the following batches effective June 1st (plan to perform on June 5th): * Celta: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FT24 * Stanton: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FRC22 * Leduc: FRC1-FRC6, FT01-FT06 *(DO NOT BLOCK TRAILERS FT4, FT5, FT9, FT11, FT12, FT15)* * Calgary: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FT24 *(DO NOT BLOCK TRAILERS FT4, FT5, FT9, FT11, FT12, FT15)* I will be adding a meeting on everyone is calendar later this month to go over this plan to make sure we are all on the same page.

"Incident to Raise with SAP: KM Freight Fees for Totes - 1 out of 2 successful - 579452/2024 Hi Kristen, Hi Linda, I am seeking guidance for 1 of the 2 tote delivery invoices which included freight fees (at cost). The first invoice I released was for Springbrook and I utilized the F02 condition code to add $15,389.05 in freight fees. This was successfully shown on the invoice. The second invoice, something different is happening. For Guadalupe, same scenario and was handled identically. However, for some reason the freight amount I added ($8,078.79) updated to a different amount on the invoice. The only key difference I can see visually, is that Guadalupe has a city tax in addition to county and state. Where Springbrook only has county and state taxes. Maybe this is affecting the coding? Please re-open the JIRA ticket associated and keep me updated. Thank you. *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen “Kris” D.

"Customer: Texts for BOLs - Limited Characters? Good afternoon, I am seeking assistance with a customer text field in S4, where we store our Bill of Lading (BOL) instructions. Specifically, “Ext. bulk ship.instr.(ship-to)” and “Ext. pkg. ship.instr.(ship-to)”. These instructions are imperative for our transportation teams who are required to visit customer sites that sometimes have specific requirements. When our scheduled dispatch loads are finalized, our drivers typically receive a MASTER BOL as well as INDIVIDUAL BOLs per site. Below is a snippet of a BOL text field I updated for SH 135946 / IVIE LAKE; however, the highlighted portions were the only parts visible to the driver. I have attached a BOL as an example. I understand this may be a lengthy text to include in the BOL, however there is no limitation when entering it into S4 and there is no way of knowing that I have met my character limit max. My questions are: # Is there a way to show us the max # of characters? # Is there a way to expand the # of characters? **Again, I want to stress the importance of this text field because it directly impacts our transport operators and daily operations as we schedule deliveries with customers. In this case, our customer has given us very specific instructions for our driver to access their site 24/7.** *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen (Kris) D.

"Underdelivery tolerance for STO's Hello SAP team, Please help with the below: When we create a STO, we always use delivery qty of 44,000 lbs. Sometimes the plant loads more, sometimes less. When less is loaded and MIGO is done on actual quantity, the STO sometimes remains open. I think this can be solved by adding a underdelivery tolerance?

"Delivery ""Completed"" via the App did not Fully PGI Hello, I have been informed that on 1/31/24, the delivery driver completed delivery 86002277 via the Delivery Ticket app, and printed a receipt from it (see below). However, in S4, it looks like the Custom Fields did not carry over into the delivery, and the PGI is not fully completed based on the doc flow. It looks like a resync may have occurred on 2/3/24, which triggered the Picking Request, but the Goods Issue document is missing. There is an Actual GI date of 1/31/24 populating in the delivery, though. Since the Requested Delivery Date of the sales order is dated 2/1/24, this was not caught for January 2024 closing. From what I can tell, this is the only delivery this has happened with so I am not sure if it is truly an app issue or user error. Can you please advise?

"Report Needed for On Time Delivery of Raw Materials We asked for this report, which we had setup in ECC with a BOBJ report but was told it was not critical. I am asking if we can find something in the next phase because I am unable complete this critical KPI. I am sure I could go through a very manual process, but I do not have time to do that. This is what the BOBJ report looks like – Runs by Company Code GNVA and Purch Organization R100. However, the key field that needs to be brought into the report is the Stat. Del. Dte that is in the Item Details under Delivery Schedule (shown below) If an order does not deliver in the month requested, if we change the Deliv. Date on the item, then we are not able to tell if it is late. Therefore, we leave the original requested delivery date in the Stat. Del. Dte field so that we can pull it in the report and determine how many days late the order is based on when it actually is posted. We need to make sure the Posting Date is included because this and the Stat Del. Dte is what we use to calculate late orders.

"help with month end reports for tax Good afternoon, I have been trying to find some of the standard reports that were in ECC that are used when doing month end tax reporting that I am struggling to find in S4. I am not sure if they are no longer available in S4 or if there is something else available to use. I also do not know if there are issues with my security access to get the reports. The following is what I am looking for. I have attached some sample reports to reference. # Report for Canada GST/HST taxes. S_ALR_87009932 (ZS_ALR_87012394) – I used the ZS_ALR_87012394 version after we implemented vertex in 2015, but I think that I could make the S_ALR_87009932 work. It just does not pull in the right descriptions. In the attached file on the 214227 tab, it shows you the information that I use to report Canada sales and VAT to the government. I use Vertex reports for the US, but this is what is used for Canada. I had asked last year about this report and was told that the S….. reports are standard SAP and should be in S4. # With all the Ap invoices that were entered in FB60, thus not using Vertex, I will need to find a way to also report the use tax that will be hitting my 214125 account. This is also something that I usually pull from Vertex, but since it was handled without POs or Vertex, I will need to find a way to pull the data. I have provided the vertex report that I use that shows some of the information that I will need. I will need a report from SAP that provides the purchase amounts with the associated taxes that are posting to 214125 that shows the tax jurisdiction, plant code, and cost center. This is something that will only be used in the interim phase of reviewing invoices that accrued use tax through FB60. Once we return to using MIRO (or whatever S4 calls it) it will go back to using vertex and the reports will come through there. # For Belgium VAT I also need to do S_ALR_87012357. I will also need assistance recreating the variant GOBE VAT AUDIT that was in ECC. In the past IBM helped me create the variant because there were more complexities with it.

If the daily invoicing reflects the same as the collective billing, it may be an issue when the customer does a review and audit of their monthly billing. Maybe we need to rethink this or gage potential issues on the customer end. At least for Magellan, I know we have a third-party payer and would like to manage the change if moved on as seamlessly as possible.

"PST and HST Missing for Ontario SHs Hello, Can you please investigate why PST and HST is not pulling in for Ontario Ship-To’s? For instance, Ship-to #s 111449 and 111819 should at least be pulling in PST, and they are not. When I look at the item conditions for a potential sales order, it is only pulling in UTXE for SH# 111819 – should not it at least be showing CTX2 in the order since it is taxable?
