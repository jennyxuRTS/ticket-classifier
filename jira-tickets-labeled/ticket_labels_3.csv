"Customer: Texts for BOLs - Limited Characters? Good afternoon, I am seeking assistance with a customer text field in S4, where we store our Bill of Lading (BOL) instructions. Specifically, “Ext. bulk ship.instr.(ship-to)” and “Ext. pkg. ship.instr.(ship-to)”. These instructions are imperative for our transportation teams who are required to visit customer sites that sometimes have specific requirements. When our scheduled dispatch loads are finalized, our drivers typically receive a MASTER BOL as well as INDIVIDUAL BOLs per site. Below is a snippet of a BOL text field I updated for SH 135946 / IVIE LAKE; however, the highlighted portions were the only parts visible to the driver. I have attached a BOL as an example. I understand this may be a lengthy text to include in the BOL, however there is no limitation when entering it into S4 and there is no way of knowing that I have met my character limit max. My questions are: # Is there a way to show us the max # of characters? # Is there a way to expand the # of characters? **Again, I want to stress the importance of this text field because it directly impacts our transport operators and daily operations as we schedule deliveries with customers. In this case, our customer has given us very specific instructions for our driver to access their site 24/7.** *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen (Kris) D.

"Underdelivery tolerance for STO's Hello SAP team, Please help with the below: When we create a STO, we always use delivery qty of 44,000 lbs. Sometimes the plant loads more, sometimes less. When less is loaded and MIGO is done on actual quantity, the STO sometimes remains open. I think this can be solved by adding a underdelivery tolerance? We have an overdelivery tolerance but not underdelivery. Or is it due to the Delivery complete – final delivery? But this is not something we manually mark when doing the MIGO. I noticed this is only when we have several line items (example Germany) – For Denmark we also had an underdelivery but the STO was marked complete automatically. Please find examples below: *Scenario 1: Germany* +Overdue materials stock in transit+ +Display purchase order 4800000004+ +Item 1 (not showing on the report)+ +Item 3 (showing on the report as not delivered)+ *+SCENARIO 2 : Denmark+* +Overdue materials stock in transit+ Kind regards Ineke Vandenbussche LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc.
