Investigate - Add WBS # to ME2J report for PO's for Project Orders Please investigate if the WBS number associated with Maintenance Orders can be added to ME2J Report Layout. ME2J displays the object assigned to the Purchase Order. This can be confusing to Project Managers when they are reviewing costs for each project as Purchase Orders for Project Maintenance Orders will display the Maintenance Order but not the WBS. To find what projects these are for the PM must drill into each PO to find out the Project/WBS. This is very tedious and time consuming when reviewing POs for multiple projects (and there is no way to group the Project Maintenance Order PO’s with the other PO’s for same project). Please advise what options are available to address this (most likely in Future Sprint). Thanks, Bob

Review/Install OSS Note 3280674 for Notification Due Date The final due date is often not calculated correctly during Maintenance Notification processing. Issues resulting from this were identified during the project and a work around was provided (S4RAID-570) but I think I found an OSS Note 3280674 that will address this. Please check OSS Note and apply to LSPI SS4 system if applicable so we can test. [3280674 - Final Due Date is Incorrect - SAP for Me| Thanks, Bob

GCAN GL Accounts 100141 and 100142 Hello, We are trying to clear two entries in GCAN gl accounts 100141 and 100142. Every time we try to reverse the entries, the system closes the journal entry so we are unable to clear them on our end. Please see attached spreadsheet for reference. *Carla Charles* Accounts Receivable Specialist LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. Email:

Account Management for PROP G/L Accounts requires update to allow Open Item Management - currently suppressed Mike Kennedy submitted request to change G/L account 153605 to a Open Item Management (OIM) account setup. This account falls under Account Group/Field Status Group PROP for 15xxxx accounts. This is in the OBD4 configuration. While standard practice is to suppress this option on Fixed Asset accounts, the reason for the suppression is for the PROP accounts that are recon A accounts. This specific account requested is a clearing account in the Property Accounts/Fixed Asset accounts section. A communication with Linda Neveu came to conclusion that there is minimal risk in setting this field to optional. G/L Master data changes are limited to only a few individuals and changes for the OIM field require additional steps if there is existing activity. Note that all other Balance sheet account groups allow OIM. The request is to move the Open Item Management from Suppress to Opt. entry.

FireFighter Access to Update Sales Orders As we initially did not use underdelivery tolerances for our customers and sales orders, many sales orders have a delivery status of partially delivered. This interferes with MRP for finished products. FireFighter access is requested to update partially delivered sales orders with an underdelivery tolerance so that SAP will consider them completely delivered.

Update Enlink Invoice to Reference Oneok? Today work was done to update Enlink data to be managed as Oneok data given the acquisition of Enlink by Oneok. I know work was done for this change in Maximo and I believe SAP as well. I noticed that there is an Invoice (172028586) within SAP which is still using the customer hierarchy number (CHN) of Enlink (2000081364) rather than the CHN of Oneok (2000012397). I am not sure if this is intended. My LSPI stores customers' invoice data within a SQL database so that the data can be quickly fetched without frequent API calls to SAP. Once an hour My LSPI looks at the invoice data stored in SAP and updates the SQL database entries to match the SAP values. Since the CHN for invoice 172028586 in SAP is still the Enlink CHN, My LSPI updates the SQL entry to be under the Enlink CHN even though we now want it to be under the Oneok CHN. I can manually update the SQL invoice’s CHN value to be under Oneok, but this will get reset at the next hour. Is changing the CHN for invoice 172028586 within SAP possible? Doing so would resolve this issue. (Thankfully this is the only Enlink invoice affected)

In cases where we need to cancel an order entirely, say b/c the customer requires a different Sold-To/Payer, do the CFSs need to cancel these intercompany documents as well: IC PO, IC sales order, IC supplier invoice/s?

Condition Contract Scales Hello I am requesting to verify that the SAP S4 system is configured to use the Graduated-to-interval scale condition, since we have a few customers that have their rebated calculated using this method.

Their rebate scales are as such per contract: Should they purchase 1,800,000 gallons of EP in a Calander year, they will receive $5,600,000 in rebates # 0-500,000=+*_$0_*+, # 500,000-1,000,000=+*_$1,000,000_*+, (500,000 gallons @ $2) # 1,000,000-1,500,000=+*_$2,500,000_*+, (500,000 gallons @ $5) # 1,500,000-1,800,000=+*_$2,100,000_*+) (300,000 gallons @ $7 Please review and let me know if SAP is setup for this type of rebate. Thanks, Mary Wilcox

Any time a report contains expenses with money owed to LSPI (“Personal” expense type) or money owed to them (out-of-pocket expenses with “Cash” payment type or “Per Diem” expense type), the report will fail to post. I met with Concur Support today and they believe it may be an issue with the SAP Integration with Concur Solutions (ICS), they just are not sure which side (SAP or Concur); that would make sense to me considering this was not really an issue before we migrated to S4, from what I understand. Concur Support has suggested that I open a ticket with SAP via [ to understand what Concur should be sending to post successfully to SAP or if Concur is already sending the correct information and a change is necessary in SAP. However, I do not have a login for that site. Is this something you could assist with? Or could you please point me in the right direction?

Is there an app to replace the ECC ABZE in fiori S4 we will need in GNVA & GCAN company codes. In the past we have used in house production transaction ABZE to create sub assets within the same year as the main asset was created. What transaction do we use in S4?

GCAN - Modify Standard Accounts Table (T030) to record PPV on Interco GCAN transactions to newly created ICPPV account 433015 There are significant Purchase Price Variants being recorded on the Cost of Goods Sold on GCAN books for Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt. The items somewhat offset each other but still result in sizeable amounts on a monthly basis if GR and IR are not recorded in the same month. For Management reporting purposes on individual sales, these items along with GCANs total Cost of Goods Sold need to be left out of the results as the true Cost of Goods Sold for these intercompany sales are the original GNVA COGS. The GCAN COGS includes the intercompany markup/discount amount so is not the true COGS from a consolidated perspective. These amounts are currently recorded to 428015 PPV - Transferred. This account is currently included in the Financial Statement Version MGMT. A new account was created 433015 to reclass the GCAN PPV on these intercompany sales. A review of the activity of 428015 indicates that it is rarely getting bookings on GNVA and those bookings since Jan 1 2023 have been USD 0.01. The GCAN reclass entry could be quite complex as it would require Customer / Material information from the individual items being reclassed. The proposal is to change the automatic bookings to record directly to the 433015 so that GCAN would not be required to perform the manual reclass each month. Instead, a GNVA monthly close step could be added to review for any activity in 433015. History shows that an entry would be rarely if ever required on GNVA since it would not be necessary to make the USD 0.01 entries. The change would only be performed for Valuation Class 8032 as discussed in the attached e-mail.

GCAN ATR - Payment Method YOU (ACH from GCAN USD bank account) is not consistent with PM V (Wire from GCAN USD bank account) in successful postings Both of these Payment Methods are out of GCAN USD Bank account: An earlier test was used on vendor 217478 and it was revealed that the vendor is currently being paid by Check in Production for GNVA due to failure in ability to make payment due to their bank setup. For this revised test, a single employee vendor 3100086 was used and two Vendor No PO documents were created. For one the Payment Method was left blank so that it would derive the YOU setup for that vendor in GCAN. For the other item, the Payment Method was set to V. When the proposal was run, the V payment item was successful while the YOU payment item had the following in the Proposal Log: | Payment method selection additional log| | Payment method selection for items due now to the amount of USD 25,000.00-| | Payment method "YOU" is being checked| | Bank details are being checked| | Customer/vendor bank details are being read| | Country/Region US / Bank key xxxxxxxxcx / Account xxxxxxxxxxxx ...| | Customer/vendor bank details are being checked| | Bank US / xxxxxxxxxxx/ xxxxxxxxx is not a domestic bank| | Customer/vendor does not have any allowed bank details| | No permitted payment method exists| |nformation re. vendor 3100086 / paying company code GCAN ...| |.. payment not possible because of reported error| This is Payment Run dated 05/01/2025 with name GCUSD.

GCAN: Z604 output does not match IC billing doc Hello! As I was retesting for GCAN to confirm that ZFS1 does NOT show on the intercompany billing document, I noticed a discrepancy between the intercompany invoice and the Z604 output. The intercompany invoice considers the ZICD Interco Discount in the Net Value, and then the 5% GST is added to it for the Total = $16,891.08: However, the Z604 output does not consider the Interco Discount in the subtotal, so the Total Amount does not match: Best regards, *Kristen Adams* *Supply Chain Business Operations Lead* LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. 2103 CityWest Blvd., Suite 1400, Houston, TX 77042 Cell: (713) 591 – 8722

Inventory Report Issue? Hello! Kristen Parker noticed a potential issue with the Stock Multiple Materials report. Can you please advise based on the info she is provided below? I think we are having an issue with the Stock Multiple Materials report. I was trying to look for the railcars that are currently in route to warehouses, I would think the material should show on the Stock Multiple Materials report as In Transit, but it does not seem like they are...which means we are understating our total inventory on our reports. DRAX195846 (STO 4800006935) left Bryan and was PGI'd out on 4/10 and has not been GR'd into Stanton yet... But the railcar does not show up on the SMM report at all. It should be listed where the red line is chronologically. However - If I use the Display Stock in Transit report... It is there.

Partially Delivered Sales Orders When we goods issue less than the delivery quantity, the sales order remains in partially delivered status. This is interfering with MRP. We have considered the following options in the customer business partner to prevent this: ||*Field*||*Description*||*Valid for All Scenarios?*||*Maintainable After Delivery/Billing?*||*Comments*|| |Complete Delivery|Complete Delivery Defined for Each Sales Order?|Yes (with workaround)|Yes|Does not impact status, only delivery creation| |Max.Part.Delv.|Maximum Number of Permitted Part Deliveries per Item (DI)|Yes|Yes|Message VL065 would require config change to suppress| |Part.dlv./item|Partial delivery at item level|Yes|Yes|Message VL061 would require config change to suppress| |Underdel. Tolerance|Tolerance Limit for Underdelivery (DI)|Yes|Yes| | Of these, Underdelivery Tolerance seems to be the best fit. For existing sales orders, we propose using mass maintenance to update the underdelivery tolerance for any sales order item with item category TAN with status Partially Delivered (VBAP-LFGSA). This would be performed with FireFighter using transaction MASS for object type BUS2032. Please provide your feedback on solution and correction method.

Remove Credit Check from Service Orders Hello! Please remove the credit check from Service Orders (SRVO).

Also, we only create service orders to bill for services already provided so a credit block does not make sense.

Accounting Entry 100007839 in GNVA 3/2025 recorded line item with both Cost Center and WBS as objects. WBS should be priority posting but it appears Cost Center took priority Entry appears below: We need to determine whether a validation check can take place to avoid this. If Validation, we also need to understand whether an Error or Warning message is appropriate. Based on quick online research, all comments pointed WBS taking the higher priority but this does not seem to be what occurred in this situation as it appears Cost Center object took precedence. This will be linked to a couple other current tickets but we want this to be considered as stand-alone item.

Question Re: EXP153\ Discreet Product Hello! Master Data created a new* **Materia* l EXP153\ w/ *Material Description* LP100 for Sales Org 1000 so we can better internally track orders of this discreet product while the customer only sees the *Material Description* of LP100 on BOL, invoice and MyLSPI documentation. However, in doing this, our initinfc_skids file that goes to GAINS now contains the EXP153\ material for over 500 Ship-To’s, which created additional SKULS in GAINS. This is not necessarily a problem, but I would like to understand if there is another way to maintain this Material in SAP so that it is only available for specific Ship-To locations?

Create SAP Web Dispatcher Header Rewrite Rules The Microsoft On-Premises Data Gateway does not natively send the Cookie header through and appears to strip any attempt to use it. This header is required by SAP to utilize cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. To fix this, a custom header (X-Custom-Session-Cookie) is being sent from Logic Apps. The SAP Web Dispatcher needs to rewrite X-Custom-Session-Cookie to Cookie for SAP to receive it correctly. This enables CSRF token validation to be enabled from Logic Apps to SAP.

SAP Direct Connection to Excel Question Hello! My manager, Minju, is wondering if there is a direct connection from SAP where we could use an existing Excel file to run a macro that would have a direct connection with S4? This primarily concerns getting data for STOs like batch #, delivery date, volume, etc. to auto populate on an internal spreadsheet we use for managing warehouse inventory. Is such a functionality possible?

Add a Default Site Product Field When uploading tank levels to GAINS, it is important for GAINS to know WHAT product is being updated. This master data currently lives under the Skid level in Maximo, but should probably live in SAP as a “Default Product” field. This could then be sent to Maximo where downstream applications could reference it. Based on double work needed by CFS to update a product, consolidation of Master Data is believed to be a good general direction and SAP would be the logical choice for being the system of record for the bulk product on a site.

1099 NEC/MISC amounts - High Priority Hello: in completing the required reporting of 1099s it has come to light that changes to vendors and their withholding tax codes have created missing information to be included in the reporting and therefore not all requirements are accurate. For example, vendor #234372, Calumet Refining LLC has payments totaling $1,086,659.80, however, changes were made on 8/28/24 that removed the withholding tax code and the amount that appeared on the 1099 was for the payments made before that date, of $834,673.21, causing the 1099 to be short the remaining payments made in 2024. Please review the setups and ensure that the withholding tax code is correct to ensure proper reporting of the 1099s. Thanks, Mary Wilcox

URGENT: Product defaulting to LB in Sales Order Hello, I am trying to process a sales order in SAP for an LP Winter tote, and I keep getting an error message for pricing. After checking the price verification, it seems to be set up correctly. With further investigation, I noticed the units in the sales order is defaulting to LB and not GAL. When I tried to change the units to GAL, I got the following error message: MASTER - I am not sure if something is set up incorrectly with the product or if this is an SAP issues, so I am creating a JIRA ticket just in case. Either way, may you please investigate the issue with this product and provide some feedback as I need to get this order processed for delivery. Much appreciated!

PS4 Unloading Point and ShipTo Data Errors It was reported today that unloading points were not correct in PS4 for a skid. Upon review, it was found that triggers were sent in error from a new Maximo testing system into SAP production (PS4) resulting in skid moves and GPS updates from 10/26 to 11/1 which were not real. This ticket is created to audit unloading points and GPS values for all sites in PS4, comparing this data to Maximo PROD which is expected to be an accurate source of truth for this data.

Any changes made to order, order goes back on credit block Good afternoon, I know there is a pending JIRA ticket, already open for orders that go on credit block and them going BACK on credit block when changes are made to the order. I was in the Sales Order Report releasing orders from credit block for invoicing, and once I released SO 3106733 to invoice, it looks like it went back on a credit block. This should not be happening and should only impact the delivery upon setting up the delivery schedule. Thanks for your help and I am looking forward to the updates. *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen “Kris” D.
