Question: How to identify blocked orders for no pricing (Z1)? Hello: Could we have a ticket opened to see why we have no visibility to when an order does not pull in pricing, please? We have all the “Blocks” pulling in on our report to help identify any potential blocks, but yet, when Obtain tried to process Delek Luther (SO#3102839) for delivery, he kept getting a message that he could not process it. When the CFS looked into the SO, there were no blocks pulling in at all – or at least not easily noticeable. In ECC, we could easily identify when a SO did not pull in pricing because it automatically reflected a Z1 No/Incorrect Pricing as shown below. | Message Obtain gets when trying to process for delivery: | | | Our report to show all potential blocks. Nothing pulled in as a block | | | All available blocks under “Sales Order Report” are check off to be viewed | | | Status Overview does not reflect a Z1 Block Is it the “Item Data Incomplete”?

DEV Test Environment for S4 - Update with Plains Pricing and Tax Good morning, I am requesting assistance with SAP’s test environment. Recently, a customer was UNDER billed for product invoicing and I am having to manually create debits to fix this billing error. However, before I complete my transaction, I would like to use S4/HANA’s test environment to execute invoicing to ensure we have certain capabilities when generating invoices. Currently, in QS4-100, PLAINS ALL AMERICAN (110327) does not have any pricing associated with LP100. I also want to ensure that all sites associated with 110327 have updated tax codes to reflect accurately on the invoices. LP100 pricing is $14.07/GAL. Please update DEV/QS4-100 so that I may perform mock transactions before I move to production. Thank you! *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen “Kris” D.

Ship to Sold To and Customer Hierarchy connections Hi Team, I am looking a bit of guidance on pulling a few pieces of data from S4 and I am wondering if there is a Tcode or Table that we would use to pull ship to accounts and show which Sold to account that they are partnered to. And I would like to also see the hierarchy account that the Sold To customer is linked to, if possible? Right now we mostly use tables KNA1 or BUT000, but these tables do not show the connections between SH/SP and SP/Hierarchy. Thanks

Cost Splitting for the Intermediate component (Zypole) of finished goods includes Mat and L&O. Is there option to record as Material in S/4? Comment in Meeting invite from Joe Casas: “Finished product material cost and L&O cost. From our meeting Friday, it looks like Zypole L&O is being placed in L&O and not in the material cost of Zypole as has been done in prior years (In matl cost also in 2024 Plan). If this is the only discrepancy, then I would like to hear from you the pro’s/con’s of both methods. My initial thoughts are to place them in the cost of Zypole as a material cost for the finished product so we are consistent with prior years and do not have to change the 2024 plan. But again, this is a new start and I am open to change if worthwhile we just need to make a decision fairly quickly and deal with change management. (Dan?, Mike?, Sharon?, Linda?, Ron?) # Continuing discussion on how to treat Zypole L&O, i.e. should it be part of material cost or leave in COS L&O bucket. Standard Costing is similar between PS4 (left) and EP1 (right). The change occurs when the Cost Splitting entry is performed in PS4: What changes would be required to get the L&O portion of the Intermediate to book to Material 413000 rather than L&O 414000?

In a conversation with Linda today about a potential enhancement of our warehouse inventory process, us using batches vs SLOC’s came up and she suggested that its probably best to use SLOCs for storage tanks and batches just for ‘transportation equipment’ like ISOs and trailers and railcars since the storage tanks never move or change really, and she said making that change now makes it easier for the potential project we are going to have with just making that very specific and consistent across the board… SOOOOO I will re-draft an email to send back out to everyone saying “nevermind, going the other way” .

We would like to standardize the way we are managing our storage tanks across all warehouses to eliminate the potential confusion, especially as we get ready to add on more warehouses and more storage tanks. We had a follow up meeting with Jackie to get clarification on the reasoning behind Calgary being SLOCs and everything else batches. Turns out there is no real “right way” and we can do whichever way works best for us. We have made the decision to change all warehouses to batches since it would be easier to change one warehouse (Calgary) instead of all of the others. So that we are not making changes mid-month, we will make these changes at the end of this month before starting the June transactions. We will now use SLOC 0001 and Batch numbers with the below naming conventions. * Stanton – FRC## * Celta – FRC## * Leduc – FRC## * Calgary – CT## * San Angelo – CT## To make things easier – we will wait until May closing to make the changes so that we are not changing in the middle of the month. At the end of this month, we will need to move the inventory in the ‘FRC#’ (FRC1-FRC9) to the ‘FRC##’ (FRC01-FRC09) “batches”. and can you please assist with this? In talking with Jackie, it sounds like we can utilize cycle counts to easily transfer the inventory. It will need to be posted effective June 1st (the afternoon of June 4th, after inventory closes) before the inventory adjustments are made to ensure reconciliation is kept correct. is willing to help with the cycle counts if needed. Jackie will be blocking the batches and maintaining the history on them so they can be referenced as needed. Let us plan to block stock in the following batches effective June 1st (plan to perform on June 5th): * Celta: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FT24 * Stanton: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FRC22 * Leduc: FRC1-FRC6, FT01-FT06 *(DO NOT BLOCK TRAILERS FT4, FT5, FT9, FT11, FT12, FT15)* * Calgary: FRC1-FRC9, FT01-FT24 *(DO NOT BLOCK TRAILERS FT4, FT5, FT9, FT11, FT12, FT15)* I will be adding a meeting on everyone is calendar later this month to go over this plan to make sure we are all on the same page. Thanks everyone! Kristen Parker Manager, Logistics LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. 2103 City West Blvd. Suite 1400. Houston, TX 77042. Cell: 832-767-8613

However, I only created it in May with start date April. Therefore, SAP has now issued 172007067 with billing date of April 1, 2024... this invoice cannot be posted as this was previous accounting month. I think we best cancel this invoice, create an invoice outside of the rental contract and amend the contract to start at next quarter. Issue is that I do not have authorization do cancel an invoice... Do you have? Kind regards Ineke Vandenbussche LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc.

Incident to Raise with SAP: KM Freight Fees for Totes - 1 out of 2 successful - 579452/2024 Hi Kristen, Hi Linda, I am seeking guidance for 1 of the 2 tote delivery invoices which included freight fees (at cost). The first invoice I released was for Springbrook and I utilized the F02 condition code to add $15,389.05 in freight fees. This was successfully shown on the invoice. The second invoice, something different is happening. For Guadalupe, same scenario and was handled identically. However, for some reason the freight amount I added ($8,078.79) updated to a different amount on the invoice. The only key difference I can see visually, is that Guadalupe has a city tax in addition to county and state. Where Springbrook only has county and state taxes. Maybe this is affecting the coding? Please re-open the JIRA ticket associated and keep me updated. Thank you. *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen “Kris” D.

Posting only possible in periods 2024/04 and 2024/03 in company code GNVA Hello, I have a newly developed UI5 application which is connected to the QS4 delivery ticket system. When I try to create a new DeliveryTicketSet item, the request fails with the following error: _Posting only possible in periods 2024/04 and 2024/03 in company code GNVA_.

PR for a refurb project Hi, I want to create a PR for a refurbishment project. With the change of SAP we have in our work instructions to select the option subcontracting (L) in the column I in the SAP window. We do not have any instruction for the column A, nevertheless, is a capital project since is a refurbishment work above 5,000. If set this configuration I have an error message, if I change to the cost centre option (in column A) I have the same error message saying it is not possible to select P/K and L at the same time, but I leave empty the column A I need to enter a SAP number in the material field which is not possible because we do not have SAP numbers for Skids and/or services. Another issue is the Account assignment window, I wrote the WBS element (new name structure since the change to S/4) and I have the following error message. I have no idea what is this about. Could you please help me with this? Kind regards, Giomar Cervantes Technical Project Engineer LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. Medialaan 50, 1800, Vilvoorde, Belgium. C: +32 471 98 05 21

SAP ticket changes - Delivery Record - Z109 Good morning, I am not sure why the changes to the information is not reflecting on the Z109 form.
