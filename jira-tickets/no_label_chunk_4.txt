Refresh QS4 100 from PS4 100 the week of March 11th To support the SAC SIT/UAT testing to be held the weeks of March 18th and March 25th a refresh of QS4 100 is being requested so that assessment data from production does not need to be replicated in QS4. Replication the assessment would require a substantial effort and the data quality may not be as good as a refresh from PS4.

161 GR Returns Needed for Returning Raw Materials to Vendor I have a return to a vendor on a raw material, PO 4502886659. I have entered line item 20 to include the return of the one part (1500 lbs) that was sent back to the vendor and checked the Returns Item box. When the shipping and receiving group (Luis Anaya and Duwayne Paulhill) attempted to do the return, they received the error that they did not have authorization for movement type 161. We have done this in the ECC system before, did the 161 movement for the return and posted the credit memo against it to make the GR/IR match. (PO 4502876975 for reference in ECC). Can we get the Shipping and Receiving department access to the 161 movement so we can ensure inventory is correct and process the return to the vendor properly? I checked with Jacklyn Henderson, and she does not see this movement in the list of transactions available, so she prompted me to put in this ticket.

Incorrect Taxes on Billing Document I know that there was a fix for tote or ISOs orders that invoiced with incorrect totals. I am having an issue going in and cancelling the invoices as it seems that it may be cancelling with the “correct” amount and not the original amount. First image is the invoice before the correction was made in Prod. The second is the current total… so if I cancel the invoice - I assume it will cancel with the incorrect amount anyway, right?

Need to understand the opportunities and implications of selecting "+/- sign change" option for Revenue accounts with Financial Statement Version FSE2 The goal is to be able to provide data that reflects Sales Revenues (Credit balances) as positive Sales line items in an Income Statement. Changes were made to MGMT in both QS4 and PS4 with expectation that this would reverse the sign appearing in Financial analysis. Both Financial Statements (S_ALR_87012284) and Market Segment Plan/Actual were run following the changes and the sign remained the same as a negative amount. The following Perfomance Assistant comments are not clear to me.

Sales Office field in Market Segment Plan/Actual app Per Debbie Faunce: The SALES OFFICE field is used to retain the hemisphere data for LSPI. The Eastern/Western hemisphere is a significant characteristic used in reviewing and managing sales results. The field was added to the allocation receivers in MANAGE ALLOCATIONS. We can allocate activity to each hemisphere in the assessment. We cannot view the results of the allocation because the field is not available in the tiles and reporting. The SALES OFFICE filed needs to be included in the reporting options for S4 tiles ALLOCATION RESULTS, MARKET SEGMENT PLAN/ACTUAL. This will allow us to review the data after the assessments are completed. The field also needs to be included in the data source list in Analysis for Office. This will allow complete set of reporting characteristics to be available to support the required reporting for the management team.

Quickest/Best method to print preview multiple invoices at once? Hello: I would like to view and/or download multiple invoices at once. I tried to view four using “Manage Billing Documents” and while the four populated, I cannot view all at once similar to “Print Outbound Delivery” for Delivery Records/Z109. I then tried to click on “Preview” to see if that would open the PDF Invoice, but then I got an message saying “No Preview Available”. So how can I print preview/download multiple Invoices at one time?

URGENT: Invoice Total Amount & Taxes Not Correct - SP 136340 Good afternoon, I would like to escalate a *+PDF INVOICE DOCUMENT ERROR+* I found in SAP. Please review the snippets below from PS4 Fiori App – “Display Billing Document” and attached invoice documents, also generated from PS4. For context: the customer requires LSPI to submit DRA invoices to their online portal against a system generated PO. It was not until today that I had access to this PO, so that is why I am just seeing this error which is, _the subtotal + taxes are not matching_. Here is what I have deduced: * Net value of invoice is $67,940.74. * Taxes for invoice (listed below), SHOULD add up to $6,080.69. * Taxes on PDF document does not match what is in SAP. * *Total Amount on PDF document is $92,263.56 (calculated taxes per PDF document is $24,322.82)* * *Total Amount on PDF document SHOULD READ $74,021.43* Please prioritize this request, as this will directly impact cash flow to the business and prevent invoices from being submitted correctly to the customer. *Best Regards,* *Kris* *Kristen (Kris) D.

Vartana Invoice Due - LSP Transport LLC Hello, After reconciling the payment proposal report and the final payment in JPM I found that the report was not fully paid by JPM on 01/23. The attached payment proposal report is showing a total amount of $3,257,725.80 but the final payment was $3,116,795.61 leaving a difference of $140,930.19. Looks like vendor 234617 was one fo the vendor that did not receive payment on 01/23. We need to check what happened on 01/23 and understand why few vendor were not paid/pulled when submitting the reports to JPM.

Delivery "Completed" via the App did not Fully PGI Hello, I have been informed that on 1/31/24, the delivery driver completed delivery 86002277 via the Delivery Ticket app, and printed a receipt from it (see below). However, in S4, it looks like the Custom Fields did not carry over into the delivery, and the PGI is not fully completed based on the doc flow. It looks like a resync may have occurred on 2/3/24, which triggered the Picking Request, but the Goods Issue document is missing. There is an Actual GI date of 1/31/24 populating in the delivery, though. Since the Requested Delivery Date of the sales order is dated 2/1/24, this was not caught for January 2024 closing. From what I can tell, this is the only delivery this has happened with so I am not sure if it is truly an app issue or user error. Can you please advise? Best regards, *Kristen Adams* *Supply Chain Systems Lead* LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. 2103 CityWest Blvd., Suite 1400, Houston, TX 77042 Cell: (713) 591 – 8722

Inspection lot generated for cycle count goods receipt. We do not have authorization for 05 inspection type This inspection type was active in ECC but did not generate inspection lots there like it is now in S/4. This inspection lot was generated from a goods receipt from a cycle count. I will be deactivating this in the material master, but I need a way to close this inspection lot and move it to unrestricted stock. Can we add movement 321/322 to MIGO authorization for lab employees?

Report Needed for On Time Delivery of Raw Materials We asked for this report, which we had setup in ECC with a BOBJ report but was told it was not critical. I am asking if we can find something in the next phase because I am unable complete this critical KPI. I am sure I could go through a very manual process, but I do not have time to do that. This is what the BOBJ report looks like – Runs by Company Code GNVA and Purch Organization R100. However, the key field that needs to be brought into the report is the Stat. Del. Dte that is in the Item Details under Delivery Schedule (shown below) If an order does not deliver in the month requested, if we change the Deliv. Date on the item, then we are not able to tell if it is late. Therefore, we leave the original requested delivery date in the Stat. Del. Dte field so that we can pull it in the report and determine how many days late the order is based on when it actually is posted. We need to make sure the Posting Date is included because this and the Stat Del. Dte is what we use to calculate late orders. I have attached the file of what the report looks like once it is run in BOBJ. Kelly Heslip Sr. Materials Buyer/Planner LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc.

Overhead costs are not getting applied to process orders causing production variance To the best of my knowledge, the formula for the overhead rates were either not maintained or maintained incorrectly which caused the overhead calculation for all January production to show a large variance. Daniel and Ketan are working on a solution in the sandbox environment to get this corrected for month end closing. The initial proposed solution was to reverse TECO and process order confirmations, migrate the formula, then reconfirm ~300 process orders. However, this could present a problem for batch management and the quality module because the batches no longer exist as the have a usage decision and moved from quality inspection status to unrestricted stock and are quickly consolidated and shipped.

Location Submission Failing On Invalid ShipTo The location cue is failing and locking up once an invalid ship to is provided. In Maximo, we have many sites which are not in SAP. If one of these shipto’s is detected, no action is needed by SAP. Should this problem be solved in SAP, in Maximo, or both? Potential Solutions: SAP - If an invalid ship to is detected, do nothing with the data and return healthy status. Maximo - Generate listing for all sites indicating which are SAP relevant and only allow SAP relevant records to send on the triggers.

Duplicate Invoices on Sales Order Report Hello! Don and I have noticed that the Sales Order Report is not accurately depicting Billing Document #s for cancelled and/or rebilled sales orders. Additionally, cancelled sales orders are showing as a positive value for the Billing Amount; therefore, it appears that this sales order (3090395) has invoiced three times for the same amount on the same Billing Document when in reality, it was cancelled and rebilled. I have also attached a report to reflect all of the duplicate invoice #s.

How to Combine Deliveries with ZDR1 Condition Defect Hello, We have been advised to avoid using the *Create Billing Documents - Billing Due List* Items app to force bill deliveries on tiered pricing due to the defect noted in [ If the first tier has a $0.00 discount, will using the *Create Billing Documents -Billing Due List* app prevent the scales from being counted accurately in the background? In PS4, currently has order # 3091749 with 20 line items, which will have a separate delivery created for each line item. The customer has requested that she submit three different invoices instead of one for this order, so we need to know which app to use to ensure we bill the customer correctly without negatively impacting how her scales/tiers are getting calculated in the system. I have attached an invoice issued to another customer (not using ZDR1 tiers) that she issued via *Create Billing Documents - Billing Due List* as an example of what we are needing to accomplish. Please advise!

help with month end reports for tax Good afternoon, I have been trying to find some of the standard reports that were in ECC that are used when doing month end tax reporting that I am struggling to find in S4. I am not sure if they are no longer available in S4 or if there is something else available to use. I also do not know if there are issues with my security access to get the reports. The following is what I am looking for. I have attached some sample reports to reference. # Report for Canada GST/HST taxes. S_ALR_87009932 (ZS_ALR_87012394) – I used the ZS_ALR_87012394 version after we implemented vertex in 2015, but I think that I could make the S_ALR_87009932 work. It just does not pull in the right descriptions. In the attached file on the 214227 tab, it shows you the information that I use to report Canada sales and VAT to the government. I use Vertex reports for the US, but this is what is used for Canada. I had asked last year about this report and was told that the S….. reports are standard SAP and should be in S4. # With all the Ap invoices that were entered in FB60, thus not using Vertex, I will need to find a way to also report the use tax that will be hitting my 214125 account. This is also something that I usually pull from Vertex, but since it was handled without POs or Vertex, I will need to find a way to pull the data. I have provided the vertex report that I use that shows some of the information that I will need. I will need a report from SAP that provides the purchase amounts with the associated taxes that are posting to 214125 that shows the tax jurisdiction, plant code, and cost center. This is something that will only be used in the interim phase of reviewing invoices that accrued use tax through FB60. Once we return to using MIRO (or whatever S4 calls it) it will go back to using vertex and the reports will come through there. # For Belgium VAT I also need to do S_ALR_87012357. I will also need assistance recreating the variant GOBE VAT AUDIT that was in ECC. In the past IBM helped me create the variant because there were more complexities with it. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding what I am looking for. Thanks, Sandy

If the daily invoicing reflects the same as the collective billing, it may be an issue when the customer does a review and audit of their monthly billing.
